## üéØ Key Metrics & Insights

The dashboard focuses on several high-level Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and detailed breakdowns:

### High-Level Metrics
| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Price** | 631,201 |
| **AVG PRICE** | 126.8 |
| **Total Quantity** | 55,271 |
| **Total Cost** | 6,899,236 |

### 1. AVG Price By Customer Type
* **Insight:** The average price paid by **Business** customers (approx. 126.84) is slightly lower than that paid by **Individual** customers (approx. 126.85). This suggests a consistent pricing structure or minimal bulk discounts.

### 2. AVG Price By Product Category
* **Key Finding:** **Robots** dominate the total price value (246,312), followed by **Drones** (155,664) and **Robot Kits** (99,660).
* **Lowest Price:** **Blueprints** show the lowest total price value (8,265).

### 3. AVG Price by Countries (Geographical Analysis)
* **Insight:** The map highlights key sales territories, primarily focused in the **Middle East** and **Mediterranean** regions, including Spain, Turkey, Libya, Sudan, Yemen, and Iran. This visual helps identify high-volume sales locations.

### 4. AVG Price By Months (Time-Series Analysis)
* **Trend:** The average price fluctuates throughout the year. The highest average price occurred in **August** (54,596), while the lowest was in **May** (42,444). This time-series view is crucial for pricing reviews.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
* **Tool:** **Tableau Desktop** (or Tableau Public/Server for viewing)
* **File Type:** `.twb` (Tableau Workbook)
* **Data Source:** Likely a transaction or sales ledger database (CSV, SQL).
